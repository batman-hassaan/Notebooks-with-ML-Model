Heart Attack Prediction Model 🫀
This project explores the relationship between vaccination data and heart attack occurrences. It uses machine learning models to predict the likelihood of a patient having a heart attack based on their demographic data, vaccination details, and pre-existing health conditions.

⚠️ Important Disclaimer: Data Bias and Model Limitations
This model is for educational purposes only and should not be used for actual medical diagnosis.

The dataset used in this project is highly imbalanced, meaning there are significantly more examples of patients who did not have a heart attack than those who did. This imbalance can introduce significant bias into the model.

How this bias affects the model:
The model may learn to prioritize a
